							<p>I got the USBscope50 oscilloscope - but wasn't able to use it, because the software that
								comes with the device is obsolete, does not run on Java 7 or Windows 7. I was able to
								find the source code for the software and I was able to modify it to work on Windows 7
								64bit and Java 7 (64bit JVM).</p>
							<p>The following instructions are good on Windows 7 64bit. The package will not work on
								32bit OS.</p>
							<p>First thing you need is the correct driver for the device - you can download the package
								here:&nbsp;<a
									href="https://github.com/phjr/usbscope50/releases/download/1.0.0/Windows_driver.rar">Windows_driver</a>
							</p>
							<p>Windows will refuse to use the driver for the device, saying it's not the correct
								device/driver combination. That's because the USB VID/PID does not match any CP210x
								device - it is a device with a custom PID. You have to force Windows to use the driver.
							</p>
							<p>The software package can be downloaded here:&nbsp;<a
									href="https://github.com/phjr/usbscope50/releases/download/1.0.0/USBscope50-Java-Software-with-JRE.zip">USBscope50
									with JRE7 for Win7 64bit</a>.&nbsp;. Once downloaded, it MUST be unpacked
								in&nbsp;c:\Program Files\Elan Digital Systems\, otherwise it will not work. Once
								unpacked, just run start.bat to launch the program.</p>
							<p>Update 21.3.2019: I have uploaded the all the sources I have <a
									href="http://peto.halicky.sk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/USBScope.rar">here</a>.</p>
							<p>Update 22.3.2019: I have also shared the sources on github, I also created a pom.xml so
								that it can be built using maven and doesn't depend on netbeans. Contributions are
								welcome!</p>
							<p>Update 26.12.2021: I do not want to keep my wordpress site anymore, so I'm archiving this page in read-only
								form and I'm moving completely to <a href="https://github.com/phjr/usbscope50">github</a>.

										<p>pf 2014</p>
										<p>Uz dva dni bojujem s USB50 (mam ho od r. 2006) a intenzivne pouzivam.
											Pocitace postupne inovujem ale jeden stary Compaq s WXP s nainstalovanym
											povodnym sw pre USB50 si stale nechavam. Na novsie PC s Vistou a W7 som
											nainstaloval novsi sw od Elanu a vsetko nadherne chodilo az po jre6.45. Len
											co prisla jre7 osciloskopik prestal chodit a trvalo mi dost dlho, kym som
											pochopil, ze sa treba kajucne vratit ku jre6. Moznost mat nainstalovane dve
											verzie javy nefungovala, jre7 bolo treba poctivo odinstalovat. Predvcerom
											som po dlhom hladani okolo sveta skoncil doma…Velmi som sa potesil a
											okamzite stiahol a nainstaloval Vas programik na PC s W8 64. V demo mode
											chodi ale nedokazem presvedcit windows aby nevyhlasovali ze poctivo
											nainstalovany driver CP210x /64 je skutocne 64 bitovy. Za radu ako force
											Windows to use the driver Vam prispejem aj na viac ako jeden beer.</p>
										<p>So srdecnym pozdravom</p>

										<p>Dakujem, uz som to konecne rozbehal, posielam cez PayPal na par piv. Nakoniec
											som aj driver natlacil - uz som to davno nerobil a vo W8 vobec, ale spomenul
											som si na postup. SiLabs bridge som nakoniec v zozname driverov nasiel a
											nainstaloval. Pretoze som zatial nepotreboval rozlisovat USB 2.0 a 3.0
											porty, chvilu mi trvalo najst na zadnom paneli PC (pod stolom) port bez
											modreho konektoru. Mudry poradca pri problemoch ma upozornil, ze USB scope
											50 nemusi s USB 3.0 pracovat. Takze treba ho zapojit do klasickeho USB 2.0
											portu a je to :).<br>
											Vas program mi ale velmi pomohol, bez neho by to asi chcelo nainstalovat
											jre6 a mozno by bol zasa problem s novsimi javovskymi aplikaciami.</p>

												<p>Hi Riyad, I'm glad I could help - and thanks for the donation :),
													much appreciated.<br>
													I had a quick look at the bitscope gadget, it does have some extra
													features (2ch, logic analyzer) but also seems to have lower speed
													(20MHz vs 75MHz). It depends what your needs are - in any case I
													wouldn't say USBscope50 is obsolete, despite its age. It still does

												<p>Hi Istvan - I could probably still find the sources somewhere. A lot

										<p>Hi everyone,<br>
											It is possible to modify VID/PID of the scope and let Windows install
											generic SiLabs driver automatically.<br>
											1/ Force install the driver as described in the article (needed only once
											for programming)<br>
											2/ Download SiLabs legacy utilities<br>
											<a href="https://www.silabs.com/community/interface/knowledge-base.entry.html/2016/11/04/cp210x_legacy_progra-zARf"
												rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.silabs.com/community/interface/knowledge-base.entry.html/2016/11/04/cp210x_legacy_progra-zARf</a><br>
											3/ Run CP210xSetIDs.exe as administrator<br>
											4/ Make sure you have selected correct device<br>
											5/ Check checkbox next to “Pid” (do not check any other checkboxes or change
											any other default values)<br>
											6/ Enter new Pid value: EA60 (old value is F001)<br>
											7/ Click Program Device button<br>
											8/ Close program, unplug and re-plug the scope<br>
											9/ Let Windows install default SiLabs driver (installs automatically)<br>
											Now Windows will recognize the USB Scope 50 as generic USB SiLabs COM port,
											so there is no need to force install the driver in the future. Scope will
											now work in any USB port on any computer (Windows 7 and above) with default
											SiLabs Windows driver.
